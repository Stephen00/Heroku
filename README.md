# discord.py-SteveBot by Stephen Graham



## Description of the bot

Personal project that made use of the discord.py library to create a discord bot with multi-purpose functionality, i.e. store user's birthdays (DD/MM) and perfoms a daily background task to check if a birthday matches the current day, if so send a message to a channel on that server. The bot also plays about with custom roles through a attempt at recreating the harry potter sorting hat
